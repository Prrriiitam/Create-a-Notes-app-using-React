# Create-a-Notes-app-using-React
Hello everyone today i created a notes app or a clone of google keep which saves notes and u can add or delete.
i created this using React js and i applied simple logic so that everyone can understand.
you can create components with name i mentioned in vs code editor but make sure to intsall node js in your pc first,so then u can run it on localhost 3000
so at last if u like that code then make sure to follow me.
Thank you!!!!!!!
